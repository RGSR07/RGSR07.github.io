 <h1><font color="#C0392B">Why I want to enroll?</font></h1>
<p>I used to read a book called “Megatrends: Ten New Directions Transforming Our Lives”. What's interesting about this book is that it was written in 1982, and then to predict what will happen in the future. Generally speaking, there are the ten points, and the next nine predictions are all based on the derivation of the first prediction, which is the replacement of the industrial society by the information society. The reason why I want to enroll in this major is because ETBD covers not only those traditional subjects such as business, but also subjects that are needed in the information age such as programming. In my opinion, learning emerging technologies has a very important meaning. Emerging technologies not only will have an important impact on changes in economic structure and the realization of sustainable development, but will bring challenges to traditional management thinking and management as well. This is why I want to enroll in this major.

<p>A few years ago, I was fortunate enough to experience a VR game called “Half-Life: Alyx” in my host family. There is an equipment in the game called Gravity Gloves. By using this equipment, players can easily pull objects from far away and then grab them. This set of actions gives the player a feel that belongs only to VR, and it also makes the "fetching objects from the air" a common and reasonable ability in VR. When not using the Gravity Glove ability, the player can also interact with almost all objects in the scene, such as open the cabinet door to see if there are any supplies in it. I can even pick up a bucket, put the things that I find useful in it, and take it with me. This kind of immersion brought by VR is not available in any traditional operating modes. In "Alyx", my favorite thing is to open cabinets to collect supplies. With the same action, in traditional games, I might hold down the button and just wait for the characters to open one drawer after another. However, VR gives a completely new experience to actions that should have been boring. I can open any drawer I want to open, or I can pick up the trash can and open the lid to see if there is anything good inside. This series of operations allowed me to actually participate in the process of playing the game, instead of ordering a character to make some actions like in a traditional game. In this VR game, I no longer need to fully follow the developer's guidance to make actions. I can intuitively think about what they would do if they faced this situation in reality. After experiencing such emerging technologies, I became very interested in learning knowledge in this area. </p>
