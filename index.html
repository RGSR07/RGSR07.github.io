<body>
<p>I am <font color="#884EA0"><b>Lai Tang</b></font> from China, Shanghai. I like to go shopping with my friends on weekends, have supper and karaoke after exams. Now I'm a freshman at Miami Oxford.</p >
 <h1><font color="#C0392B">Why I want to enroll?</font></h1>
<p>The name of the Department really attracts me at first, Department of Emerging <font color="#2E86C1"><b>Technology</b></font> in <font color="#28B463"><b>Business</b></font> + <font color="#FF5733"><b>Design</b></font>. 
<p>With the development of the times, <font color="#2E86C1"><b>technology</b></font> has become indispensable. We rely on it increasingly, such as mobile payment and electronic door lock. Under such a trend, we can also know the professions related to technology have good prospects for development.
<p><font color="#28B463"><b>Business</b></font> as a hot classic discipline in the University. In my mind, it's directly related to money. And after browsing program requirements, I found that what we need to learn is to analyze users and social media marketing, which is exactly what I am interested in of business.</p >
<p><font color="#FF5733"><b>Design</b></font> is like a finishing touch, adding the sensory enjoyment to ordinary objects. I think When most of us aren’t struggling to make a living, rich design is one of the things we aspire to. For example, Apple sells more phones than any other brand, because regardless from the system, the outward appearance as well as the shops all has conforms to the populace taste design feeling. As a person who loves designed objects, I also would like to have my own work. In addition, I am surrounded by people including myself who always think I am a creative and energetic person and many of my family and friends are engaged in design or painting related work.</p >
<p>These three words together mean to me that I will enter a field that is in line with social trends, that makes money and that I am interested in. This is the reason why I want to apply for this major.
<h1><font color="#C0392B">What interests me most about Digital and Emerging Technology?</font></h1>
<p>It was the summer of 2019, and that was the first time I experienced it up close and personal. One day, a friend of mine said she wanted to go to an exhibition, and I briefly browsed through it, and with the idea of wanting to dabble in some art at the time, I just bought a ticket. The exhibition was called <b>Universe of Water Particles in the Tank</b>. It is from Teamlab, a group of well-known Japanese "ultratechnologists", I learn from later. When I stepped through the door unprepared, I was completely blown away. I stood in the middle of the 270° digital "waterfall" and the flowers under my feet gradually bloomed, more and more, and before long they engulfed the waterfall. Then there was a gradual dissipation of the same frequency. The feast of light and shadow, full of technology, really opened my eyes. I strolled between the flowers and the waterfall, an immersive pleasure that even 4D movies could not let me experience.This exhibition was like a beginning for me and brought me into a whole new field. At the end of 2019, Teamlab opened a permanent art gallery in Shanghai, which I also visited once, and the lights there changed color wherever I stood, and if I saw a cluster of lights changing color in the distance, it meant that there was a person standing there. There was another one that made a deep impact on me, <b>Ocean By Naked</b>, where I swam with sharks at 6500m under the sea and listened to rainbow-colored <font color="#D35400">w</font><font color="#F5B041">h</font><font color="#58D68D">a</font><font color="#3498DB">l</font><font color="#8E44AD">e</font><font color="#F1C40F">s</font> murmuring at 423m. I used to be a person who was very afraid of the sea, but there I had the ability to create vortices with my bare hands. As a visitor, it was amazing, and I couldn't imagine how fast technology has evolved. What appeals to me most about Digital and Emerging Technology is that designers and engineers use cold codes and machines to create interesting and fascinating scenarios.<p>
